The main reason that I like to go to the Red Hill Park in the holidays is that it's not very far from where l live. It only takes me 15 minutes to walk there. In addition, as a student, I’m not that loaded financially, and a Red Hill Park trip isn’t going to cost too much, I guess that's one of the reasons that I love to go there too.

As for the reason that Iwould love to visit Los Angeles the most is that I'm a big fan of Kobe Bryant.Iwish I could have a chance to see him play but it never happened. Now that he has
already retiredI still have this dream to go to the Staples Center and watch a live game of Los
Angeles Lakers.I think that is going to be one of the happiest moments in my life.
