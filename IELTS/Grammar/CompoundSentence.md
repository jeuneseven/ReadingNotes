## 表语从句

* 含义：一个句子做表语，放在主句里
* 写法：主句（表语从句（连接词+陈述句））
* 位置：系动词后面

* 写法：主句（同位语从句（连接词+陈述句））
* 位置：放解释的抽象名词后

# 定语从句

## 概述

* 概念：一个句子做定语，修饰限定名词，把名词的范围确定下来
* 位置：放在所修饰的名词后面

This is **the job**.
I have dreamed of **the job** for years.

This is the job which I have dreamed of for years.

* which 为关系词: 起到连接句子的作用、做句子的成分
* which I have dreamed of for years 为定语从句
* the job 为先行词，被定语从句修饰的词
* 定语从句中关系词=先行词

## 写法

* 写法：主句（先行词n. + 定语从句（先行词+陈述句））
* 定语从句中作宾语的关系词可以省略

| 先行词 | 关系词 | 注意 |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 事/物 | which/that | |
| 人 | who/whom/that | whom 只能做宾语，who/that 做什么成分都可以 |
| 人/物 (某人的/某物的) | whose | |
| 时间 | when | |
| 地点 | where | |
| 原因 | why | |

## 分类

* 限定性: I met your friend who is staying in Paris.
	* 限定性的名词的范围不确定，需要定语从句来确定
* 非限定性: I met your mother, who is staying in Paris.
	* 限定的名词范围确定，定语从句用来补充说明
	* 范围如果是绝对明确(父母、地球...)或在上下文中相对明确时使用,
	* 不能用that

## 补充

* 介词提前的定语从句 介词 + which/whom

They have polluted the environment in which we live.

# 状语从句

* 含义：一个句子做状语，表达描述性的信息
* 写法：主句（状语从句（从属连词+完整的陈述句））
	* 从属连词不可以省略，表达想补充的相关信息

| 分类 | 从属连词 | 是否重点 | 注释 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 时间 | when/while/as; before/after; since/until; as soon as; by the time | 是 | while/as 通常接延续性动作，或进行时；when 可以接瞬间动作或延续性动作都可以 |
| 地点 | where | 否 | |
| 原因 | because/since/as | 是 | |
| 结果 | so...that.../such...that...; so that... | 是 | so that... 表示「所以...」引出结果；so...that.../such...that... 表示 「太...以至于...」so 后接形容词副词； such 后接名词或名词性词组  |
| 目的 | so that ... / in order that ... | 否 | 目的状语从句中一定会有情态动词 (might etc.) |
| 条件 | if / unless / once / as long as | 是 | 表示「如果不... / 除非... / 一旦... / 只要...」 |
| 让步 | although / though / even though / even if | 是 | 表示「尽管... 即使...」明让步，暗转折 转折后的内容更重要 英语中一个句子中只能有一个连接词 |
| 比较 | than / as | 否 |  |
| 方式 | as | 否 | 表示「按照...方式」 |

## 位置

* 放在主句前
	* When he comes back, I will let you know.
* 放在主句后
	* I will let you know, when he comes back.

	* I, when he comes back, will let you know.

# 特殊结构-分裂结构

## 造成原因

* 同位语：解释说明前面名词
	* My teacher, **Ms. Lee**, will attend the meeting.
* 插入语：后来插入到句子中的额外补充说明的成分
	* My teacher, **together with her colleagues**, will attend the meeting.

## 特点

* 逗号、破折号、括号成对出现

## 解决方案

* 一般情况下，可以去掉不看，取决于考察的是主旨还是细节

# 特殊结构-平行结构

## 定义

* 也叫并列结构，把多个元素并在一起做一个成分
	* **The English, the Germans, the Dutch, and the French** were investing in Britain's former colony.

## 特点

* 并列连词/组
* 词性相同，形式一致

# 虚拟

## 定义

* 跟真实情况相反
* 跟假设情况相反
* 表达的是非真实的情况

## 如何表达

* 改变语态
* 本质是谓语动词的变化表达非真实

## if条件句的虚拟

从句往前推，主句4+1，将来同现在

| 时间范围 | if从句 | 主句 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 假设过去 | had done | would/could/should/might | + have done |
| 假设现在 | did/were |  | + do |
| 假设将来 | did/were |  | + do |
|  | were to do |  |  |
|  | should do |  |  |

### 假设现在

* if从句: 从句往前推一个时态，一般过去时，did were(无论单复数)
* 主句: could/would/should/might + do
	* If I had a billion dollars / If I were a billionaire, I would donate all the money to the charity.
	* If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put U and I together.

### 假设过去

* if从句: 过去完成时，had done
* 主句: could/would/should/might + have done
	* If he had played last season, we would have won the match.
	* Years ago if someone had turned round to me and said "in two years you'll be England captain", I would have turned round and said, "I don't think so!"

### 假设将来

* if从句:did/were，were to do / should do 将来同现在
* 主句: could/would/should/might + do
	* If I were to live my life over again, I would have you as my wife.

## 宾语从句的虚拟

* 主句的谓语动词表示「建议/命令/要求」
* 例如：suggest/advise/propose/recommend/order/ask/demand/insist/require/request ...
* 从句的谓语动词用「should+动词原形」第三人称单数/一般过去时等都不需要改变形态
	* He suggested that a double railway-tunnel (should) be built.
	* The workers demanded they should be given the wages that they should get.

# 倒装句

* 定义：把一个句子中的成分颠倒顺序，主谓倒装比较常见
* 原因：强调突出信息
* 分类：全部倒装、部分倒装

## 全部倒装

* 把谓语动词全部挪到主语前面
* Here comes the bus.
* On the top of the mountain lies a temple.

### There be 句型

* there be + n. + (介词短语/doing) 表示 有... 表示客观存在，不表示拥有
	* be 可以是过去、现在、将来时，等不同时态
	* 注意单复数
* There is a girl crying in the classroom. => A girl is there.
* There are two key factors behind this trend.
* One respondent to the survey believed that **there is no true emotional bonding** without touching and smelling a loved one.
* This suggests that **there has been a dichotomy** between the guest environment provided in luxury hotels and the working conditions of their employees.

## 部分倒装

* 把谓语动词部分挪到主语前面，一部分留在后面，相当于变一般疑问句
	* You will never know the truth. => Never will you know the truth.
	* He cares little for my words. => Little does he care for my words. 
* 遇到否定词或词组在句首，需要用到部分倒装
	* I had no sooner got the invitation than I refused. => No sooner had I got the invitation than I refused. 
* Only 位于句首
	* We can learn English well only in this way. => Only in this way can we learn English well .
	* He achieved his goal only by working hard. => Only by working hard did he achieve his goal.
* 虚拟条件句中省略了if
	* If he had played last season, we would have won the match. =>  Had he played last season, we would have won the match.
