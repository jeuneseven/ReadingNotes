| A Comparison of Architectural Patterns for Testability and Performance Quality for iOS Mobile Applications Development | 1. Empirically evaluates MVC, MVVM, and MVI patterns using a case-study approach.<br>2. Focuses on performance and testability aspects.<br>3. Provides clear benchmarks and comparisons. | 1. Limited in scope to only three architectural patterns.<br>2. Does not discuss the impact of design patterns on user experience.<br>3. Lacks consideration of newer or hybrid architectural patterns. |
| Model View Controller in iOS Mobile Applications Development                                          | 1. Deep dives into MVC's implementation challenges and solutions.<br>2. Offers practical advice for avoiding common MVC issues.<br>3. Emphasizes MVC's versatility and adaptability in iOS.     | 1. Exclusively centered on MVC, missing a broader architectural context.<br>2. Limited discussion on integrating MVC with other patterns.<br>3. Does not address scalability concerns with MVC.     |
| Pathways for Statically Mining the Model-View-Controller Software Architecture on Mobile Applications | 1. Introduces novel static analysis techniques for MVC.<br>2. Enhances automatic detection of architectural patterns.<br>3. Can improve architectural compliance checking.                       | 1. Focuses on static analysis, potentially overlooking dynamic aspects.<br>2. Mainly theoretical, with limited practical application examples.<br>3. Specific to MVC without addressing other patterns. |
| Software Architectural Principles in Contemporary Mobile Software: From Conception to Practice       | 1. Broad overview of architectural principles in mobile software.<br>2. Discusses principles from both conceptual and practical viewpoints.<br>3. Includes case studies for real-world application. | 1. More general, lacking depth in specific architectural patterns.<br>2. Primarily focused on Android, with less relevance to iOS.<br>3. Could benefit from more examples of principle application.     |
| Review of iOS Architectural Pattern for Testability, Modifiability, and Performance Quality           | 1. Comparative analysis of multiple iOS architectural patterns.<br>2. Focuses on testability, modifiability, and performance.<br>3. Offers insights into choosing suitable patterns for different needs. | 1. Might not fully explore the latest iOS development trends.<br>2. Lacks detailed discussion on the integration challenges between patterns.<br>3. Some findings may not be applicable to all project sizes or types. |
