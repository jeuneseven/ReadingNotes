| Software Architectural Principles in Contemporary Mobile Software: from Conception to Practice | - Emphasizes the central role of software architecture in enhancing mobile software quality, closely related to ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics like maintainability and reusability.<br>- Empirical analysis on the application of architectural concepts in Android apps supports quality characteristics such as performance efficiency and compatibility outlined in ISO/IEC 25010.<br>- Identifies architectural issues within Android development, such as inconsistent hierarchical decomposition and extensibility limitations, indirectly highlighting areas for improvement in maintainability and portability defined by ISO/IEC 25010. | - Focuses mainly on architectural principles and patterns with less direct exploration on how these principles impact a wider range of quality characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 25010, such as security, reliability, and usability.<br>- Lacks explicit connection between architectural decisions and systematic evaluation of software quality based on ISO/IEC 25010 standards. Integrating assessment tools or methodologies for directly assessing the impact of architectural decisions on each quality characteristic could strengthen the analysis.<br>- While identifying architectural issues and their theoretical implications for mobile software quality, could further explore practical frameworks or recommendations for developers to systematically address these issues within ISO/IEC 25010 scope. |
| Review of iOS Architectural Pattern for Testability, Modifiability, and Performance Quality | - **Empirical Evaluation**: Conducts a thorough comparative analysis of iOS architectural patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER) using empirical data, directly aligning with ISO25010's emphasis on evidence-based assessment.<br>- **Quality Focus**: Specifically addresses testability, modifiability, and performance—key quality characteristics in ISO25010—providing valuable insights into how architectural choices impact these areas.<br>- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers a range of architectural patterns widely used in iOS development, offering a broad perspective that can inform decisions on architectural design with respect to software quality. | - **Limited Scope on Other Quality Characteristics**: While it provides an in-depth analysis of certain ISO25010 quality characteristics, it may not fully explore other important qualities such as security, usability, and compatibility.<br>- **Potential Bias Towards Certain Architectures**: The methodology and criteria for evaluating architectural patterns might introduce bias, emphasizing certain architectures over others without a holistic view of all potential trade-offs.<br>- **Generalizability**: The findings, especially around performance metrics, may vary significantly based on the specific application context, development environment, or iOS version, potentially limiting the generalizability of the results to all iOS development scenarios. |
