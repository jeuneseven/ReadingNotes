| Software Architectural Principles in Contemporary Mobile Software: From Conception to Practice | 1. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of software architectural principles on the development of modern mobile software, highlighting the transition from traditional practices to contemporary approaches.<br>2. It traces the evolution of architectural principles in Android, showing how these principles have been integral to Android's success in fostering a rich ecosystem of apps.<br>3. Offers a detailed empirical study by mining the architecture of hundreds of Android apps across different repositories, providing valuable insights into the actual use of architectural concepts in practice.<br>4. Identifies specific Android architectural patterns and anti-patterns, contributing to a deeper understanding of mobile software architecture's best practices and common pitfalls.<br>5. The paper discusses the implications of its findings for both practitioners and researchers, setting the stage for future research in mobile software architecture. | 1. The study's focus on Android as the predominant platform might limit the applicability of its findings to other mobile ecosystems.<br>2. Some architectural anti-patterns and deficiencies identified may have already been addressed in newer Android versions, given the rapidly evolving nature of mobile platforms.<br>3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on how the identified architectural principles could be effectively applied in the design and development of mobile apps across different platforms.<br>4. While the empirical study is extensive, it may not fully account for the diversity of app categories and their specific architectural needs.<br>5. The recommendations for addressing architectural smells and anti-patterns in Android could be expanded to provide more concrete, actionable guidance for developers. |
