| Software Architectural Principles in Contemporary Mobile Software: from Conception to Practice | - Emphasizes the central role of software architecture in enhancing mobile software quality, closely related to ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics like maintainability and reusability.<br>- Empirical analysis on the application of architectural concepts in Android apps supports quality characteristics such as performance efficiency and compatibility outlined in ISO/IEC 25010.<br>- Identifies architectural issues within Android development, such as inconsistent hierarchical decomposition and extensibility limitations, indirectly highlighting areas for improvement in maintainability and portability defined by ISO/IEC 25010. | - Focuses mainly on architectural principles and patterns with less direct exploration on how these principles impact a wider range of quality characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 25010, such as security, reliability, and usability.<br>- Lacks explicit connection between architectural decisions and systematic evaluation of software quality based on ISO/IEC 25010 standards. Integrating assessment tools or methodologies for directly assessing the impact of architectural decisions on each quality characteristic could strengthen the analysis.<br>- While identifying architectural issues and their theoretical implications for mobile software quality, could further explore practical frameworks or recommendations for developers to systematically address these issues within ISO/IEC 25010 scope. |
